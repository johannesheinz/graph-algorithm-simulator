## Setup

1. Clone this project and checkout the master branch
2. Install a current version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
3. Open your terminal and execute the following command to start the app in a watch mode:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
4. Start hacking :)

## Architecture

There is basically no such thing as an architecture. The project is still in an emerging stage. So feel free to restructure code.
Just follow the [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) for code.
